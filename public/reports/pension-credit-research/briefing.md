# Pension Credit & Guarantee Credit - Missing Paperwork Solution

**Target Context:** £5,000/month income scenario – Focus on saving on council tax to reduce outgoings

---

## 1. GUARANTEE CREDIT OVERVIEW

### What is Guarantee Credit?

Guarantee Credit is the main part of Pension Credit that tops up your weekly income to a minimum amount if you're over State Pension age and on a low income. It's a tax-free benefit designed to ensure pensioners have a basic income level.

### Current Income Thresholds (April 2025 - March 2026)

- **Single person:** £227.10 per week
- **Couple:** £346.60 per week

If your weekly income (including State Pension, private pensions, and most benefits) is **below these amounts**, you may receive Guarantee Credit to bring you up to the threshold.

### Important Note for £5k/month (£1,154/week) Income

With a monthly income of £5,000 (approximately £1,154 per week), you would **not normally qualify** for Guarantee Credit as this exceeds the thresholds significantly. However, you may still be eligible for **Council Tax Reduction** separately if you're on a low income after housing costs, or if you have substantial savings/capital considerations.

### Eligibility Criteria

1. **Age:** You must have reached State Pension age (currently 66, increasing to 67 between April 2026 - March 2028)
2. **Residency:** Must live in England, Scotland, or Wales
3. **Income:** Your weekly income must be below the threshold (unless you have extra responsibilities/costs)
4. **Savings:** Must have £10,000 or less in savings and investments (every £500 above £10,000 counts as £1 weekly income)

### What Counts as Income?

- State Pension
- Occupational/private pensions
- Earnings from employment/self-employment
- Most benefits (Carer's Allowance, etc.)
- **Not counted:** Attendance Allowance, DLA, PIP, Housing Benefit, Council Tax Reduction, Winter Fuel Payment, Child Benefit, Christmas Bonus

### Extra Amounts You May Qualify For

If you get Guarantee Credit, you may also get additional payments for:

- **Severe disability:** +£82.90/week (single) or +£165.80/week (couple)
- **Caring for someone:** +£46.40/week
- **Housing costs:** Ground rent, service charges (not mortgage payments)
- **Children/young people:** £67.42-£78.10/week per child

### When to Apply

- You can start your application **up to 4 months before** reaching State Pension age
- You can apply **any time after** reaching State Pension age
- Can be **backdated up to 3 months** if you were eligible during that period

### How to Apply

You have three options:

#### **A. Online Application** (Fastest if eligible)

**Website:** **https://apply-for-pension-credit.service.gov.uk/**

**Eligibility for online application:**
- You've already claimed your State Pension
- You're NOT living with someone under 16 or between 16-19 in full-time education
- You can complete the application in **one sitting** (no save/return feature)

#### **B. By Phone** (Recommended for most people)

**Pension Credit Claim Line:** **0800 99 1234**

(Monday-Friday, 8am-6pm, free from mobiles and landlines)

**Process:**
1. Call 0800 99 1234
2. Tell the operator: "I want to claim Pension Credit"
3. Answer questions about your circumstances, income, and savings
4. They may put payments in place straight away if they have all information, OR send you a form to complete
5. **Always ask for backdating** when you apply (up to 3 months)

**Someone else can call for you** if you're unable to use the phone. They must be with you during the call to ensure accurate answers.

#### **C. By Post**

1. Request a form by calling 0800 99 1234 (or download from GOV.UK)
2. Complete the form (PC1 form)
3. Send to:
   ```
   Freepost DWP Pensions Service 3
   (No stamp or postcode needed)
   ```
4. Contact **Citizens Advice** or **Age UK** for help filling out the form if needed

### Information You'll Need

Gather these before applying:

- **Your National Insurance number** (found on P60, National Insurance card, or payslips)
- **Bank account details** (account number, sort code)
- **Income information:**
  - State Pension amount
  - Private/occupational pension amounts
  - Other benefits you receive
  - Earnings if working
- **Savings and investments:** Total value of all accounts, ISAs, Premium Bonds, shares, etc.
- **Housing costs:** Rent or mortgage payments, ground rent, service charges
- **Date you want to backdate to** (usually 3 months ago or your State Pension age date)
- **Partner's details** if you live together (same information for them)

### What Happens After Application

- If DWP has all information: decision and payments can be immediate
- If more information needed: they'll contact you within 1 month; you must respond within 1 month (ask for extension if needed)
- You'll receive a letter if successful showing weekly amount and payment date
- Payments made every 4 weeks into your bank account

## 4. NS&I PREMIUM BONDS IMPACT

### Do Premium Bonds Affect Pension Credit?

**Yes, Premium Bonds are counted as savings/capital** when DWP calculates your Pension Credit.

### Savings Threshold Rules

- **£10,000 or less:** Ignored completely (does not affect your claim)
- **Over £10,000:** Every £500 (or part of £500) over £10,000 counts as **£1 income per week**

#### Examples:

- If you have **£11,000** in Premium Bonds + other savings = **£2 deemed income per week**
- If you have **£25,000** total savings = **£30 deemed income per week** (£15,000 over £10,000 = 30 x £500 increments)

### Premium Bonds Specifics

- The **face value** of your Premium Bonds counts as savings (not potential prize money)
- Prizes you win are **tax-free** and not counted as income for Pension Credit purposes
- If you cash in Premium Bonds, the money becomes part of your capital/savings total

### Strategy for £5k/month Income Context

If you have significant Premium Bonds holdings:
1. **Calculate total savings** (Premium Bonds + bank accounts + ISAs + shares + cash)
2. If over £10,000, the deemed income could affect your Guarantee Credit eligibility
3. **Important:** Even with high savings, you may still qualify for **Council Tax Reduction** separately

---

## 5. COUNCIL TAX REDUCTION LINK

### Does Guarantee Credit Automatically Give You Full Council Tax Reduction?

**No, you must apply separately for Council Tax Reduction** – it is not automatic even if you receive Guarantee Credit.

### What Guarantee Credit Means for Council Tax Reduction

- If you receive **the Guarantee Credit part** of Pension Credit, you **may** get your **full Council Tax bill paid** by the council
- However, each local council operates its own scheme and assesses your application individually
- Having Guarantee Credit makes you eligible for maximum support, but you must complete a **separate Council Tax Reduction application**

### How to Apply for Council Tax Reduction

1. **Contact your local council** – they use the same scheme for pensioners across England, Scotland, Wales
2. Apply online at: **https://www.gov.uk/apply-council-tax-reduction**
3. Or call/visit your local council's Council Tax office
4. You'll need to provide:
   - Proof of Pension Credit award letter (see Section 2 if lost)
   - Your council tax account reference
   - Details of your income and savings
   - Details of other adults living in the household

### If Council Refuses or Gives Less Than Full Reduction

**Step 1: Request Mandatory Reconsideration**
- Write to the council within **1 month** of their decision
- Explain why you think the decision is wrong
- Provide any additional evidence
- The council **must respond within 2 months**

**Step 2: Appeal to Valuation Tribunal**
- If the council upholds their decision, you can appeal
- Appeal must be made within **2 months** of the reconsideration decision
- Contact: **Valuation Tribunal for England** (or Wales/Scotland equivalents)
- There's no fee to appeal

**During the appeal:** Continue paying your Council Tax (or you could face recovery action). If successful, you'll get a refund.

### Key Points

- **You must apply** – don't assume Guarantee Credit automatically gives you Council Tax Reduction
- Having Guarantee Credit should qualify you for **full reduction**, but the council may still assess based on your specific circumstances
- If refused, challenge the decision promptly (1 month deadline for reconsideration)

### How Far Can You Backdate?

**Up to 3 months** from your claim date, provided you were eligible during that period.

### Automatic Backdating

If you're over State Pension age throughout the entire 3-month period (or reached State Pension age within the last 3 months), your claim will be automatically backdated to:
- The date you reached State Pension age, OR
- 3 months before your claim date, whichever is later

### How to Request Backdating

**Always ask for it when you apply** – either online (select backdate option), by phone (tell the operator), or on the paper form (tick the box).

### Example

- You reach State Pension age on **January 15, 2025**
- You apply for Pension Credit on **April 10, 2025**
- Your claim will be automatically backdated to **January 15, 2025**
- You'll receive backdated Pension Credit in your first payment (could be several hundred pounds)

**Note:** You cannot backdate beyond 3 months. If you were eligible 6 months ago but only just applying, you'll only get 3 months backdated.

## 11. SUMMARY FOR £5K/MONTH INCOME CONTEXT

If you have an income of £5,000 per month (£1,154 per week):

1. **You likely won't qualify for Guarantee Credit** as your income exceeds the £227.10/£346.60 thresholds.
2. **BUT** you may still qualify for **Council Tax Reduction** if:
   - Your income after housing costs is low
   - You have high housing costs relative to income
   - You have a disability or caring responsibilities
   - Your council uses "working age" rules that are more generous
3. **Apply for Council Tax Reduction separately** – don't assume income level disqualifies you
4. **Check your savings level** – if under £16,000 (or even higher if getting Guarantee Credit), you may qualify
5. **Contact your local council** directly to apply for Council Tax Reduction
6. **If you DO get Guarantee Credit** (due to other factors), you should qualify for full Council Tax Reduction but must still apply

### Action Steps (If earning £5k/month and wanting to save on council tax):

1. **Call your local council** about Council Tax Reduction
2. **Request an application form** or apply online
3. **Provide details of your income and expenses** – the council calculates "disposable income"
4. **Mention any disability, caring responsibilities, or high housing costs**
5. **If refused**, ask for a mandatory reconsideration with supporting evidence of your financial circumstances
